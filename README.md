# Interpreted-Programming-Language
A small programming language with the basic features


This is not a good programming language! I only made this to learn and have fun!

Things to do:

 - Add more data types (strings, lists, dictionaries, booleans)
 - Add more and better errors
 - Add more built in functions
 - MAKE CODE CLEANER
