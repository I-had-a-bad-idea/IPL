# IPL (Interpreted Programming Language)

A simple interpreted programming language implemented in Rust that supports object-oriented programming concepts, control flow, and built-in functions.

## Features

- **Variables**: Dynamic variable assignment 
- **Control Flow**: 
  - `if`/`elif`/`else` conditionals
  - `while` loops with `break`/`continue`
  - `for` loops with iteration over lists
  - `break` and `continue` statements
- **Functions**:
  - Function definitions with parameters
  - Return values
  - Built-in functions for I/O and math
- **Data Types**:
  - Numbers (floating point)
  - Strings
  - Lists
  - Booleans (`True`/`False`)
  - `None`
- **Classes & Objects**:
  - Class definitions with inheritance
  - Constructor methods
  - Instance methods
  - Class variables and instance variables
  - Method overriding
- **File Imports**: Import code from other `.ipl` files
- **Operators**:
  - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` 
  - Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  - Logical: `and`, `or`
  - Member access: `.`
